# Cybersecurity assignment
## Our team:

Due to very short deadlines, we could not submit our full work on time even though we had sleepless nights and engaged well with the course material. We want to respect the course and you, Professor, by completing the tasks fully even though the official submission has already passed. After all, the main purpose of this course is to study, not to receive grades =)

Just like for the Cybersecurity course, we have tried super hard for the Computer Networks course. We tried to dive deep into the tasks, especially into the industrial networks one. We would like to kindly ask you to also review the full version of the Computer Networks assignment. It is really important to us.

Thank you in advance, Professor!

This is our cybersecurity assignment repository where you can find SQL injection, JWT, and HMAC tasks. The documentation for these tasks is provided in each task's directory.
