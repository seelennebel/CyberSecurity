# Cybersecurity assignment
## Our team:
### - Andrii Amitan
### - Akerke Nurmagambetova
Due to very short deadlines, we could not submit our full work on time even though we had sleepless nights and engaged well with the course material. We want to respect the course and you, Professor, by completing the tasks fully even though the official submission has already passed. After all, the main purpose of this course is to study, not to receive grades =)

Thank you in advance, Professor!

This is our cybersecurity assignment repository where you can find SQL injection, JWT, and HMAC tasks. The documentation for these tasks is provided in each task's directory.
